# How to Build and Start the Project Containers

> All commands are run from the root project directory

1. Create a `.env` file in the root project directory
   - Update the values found in `.env.example` and docker will set those values as environment variables for the containers

2. Package the java project using the following command:
```bash
mvn clean package -DskipTests
```

3. Start the containers using docker compose:
```bash
# start all containers (--build is only necessary the first time)
docker compose up -d --build

# start only the frontend / backend / db
docker compose up -d frontend

# stop all containers
docker compose down

# stop specific container
docker compose down backend
```
